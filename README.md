protocoilmag
============

Proto Coil Mag is a prototyping tool for modeling the magnetic field in air of different coil shapes.

##Notes
1. I changed some lines based on [Petar Petrov's version](https://github.com/pip010/protocoilmag)
and make the demo work on Firefox 40.0.2.
2. Colormap still fails on this version.
